'BAHIA COCOA REVIEW Showers continued throughout the week in\nthe Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early\nJanuary and improving prospects for the coming temporao,\nalthough normal humidity levels have not been restored,\nComissaria Smith said in its weekly review.\n    The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.\n    Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags\nof 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93\nmln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems\nthat cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the\narrivals figures.\n    Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how\nmuch old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has\npractically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates\naround 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there\nare a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,\nmiddlemen, exporters and processors.\n    There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit\nfor export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in\nobtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.\n    In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have\nsold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.\n    Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350\ncruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.\n    Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and\nonly limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to\n1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.\n    New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with\nJune/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs\nunder New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs\nper tonne FOB.\n    Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at\n4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.\n    April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July\nat 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at\n2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and\n2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.\n    Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas,\nUruguay and open ports.\n    Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for\nMarch/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times\nNew York Dec for Oct/Dec.\n    Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible\ncurrency areas.\n    Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325\nand 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New\nYork July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York\nSept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith\nsaid.\n    Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags\nagainst the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88\ncrop.\n    Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to\nbe published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after\ncarnival which ends midday on February 27.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0

'U.S. BANK DISCOUNT BORROWINGS 310 MLN DLRS U.S. bank discount window borrowings\nless extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to\nWednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.\n    The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131\nmln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs\nat 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week\nstatement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451\nmln dlrs.\n    Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February\n25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of\n644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.\n    A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that\nthere were no large single day net misses in the Fed\'s reserve\nprojections in the week to Wednesday.\n    He said that natural float had been \"acting a bit\nstrangely\" for this time of year, noting that there had been\npoor weather during the latest week.\n    The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500\nmln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to\nnearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.\n    The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday\'s high\nfloat, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday\'s\nfloat figure was due to holdover and transportation float at\ntwo widely separated Fed districts.\n    For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of\nadjustments were \"small,\" adding that they fell to a negative\n750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for\nunrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the\ncountry.\n    The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two\ndifferent clearing banks had system problems and the securities\nand Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or\n2100 EST on both days.\n    However, he said that both problems were cleared up during\nboth afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve\nimpact.\n    During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount\nwindow borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct\nby the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional\ninstitutions.\n    On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by\nthe money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and\n15 pct by the smallest banks.\n    The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess\nreserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on\nFriday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average\ndeficit for the week as a whole.\n    For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high\nexcess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at\nthe smallest banks.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
'AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF American Express Co remained silent on\nmarket rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson\nLehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be\nconsidering such a move because it is unhappy with the market\nvalue of its stock.\n    American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the\nmarket calculated a partially public Shearson may command a\ngood market value, thereby boosting the total value of American\nExpress. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial\nservices firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.\n    American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at\n72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.\n    American Express would not comment on the rumors or its\nstock activity.\n    Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts\'\nmeeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement\nyesterday of management changes.\n    At the meeting, company officials said American Express\nstock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance\nof Shearson, according to analysts.\n    Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief\noperating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of\npresident, which had been vacant. It also created four new\npositions for chairmen of its operating divisions.\n    Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most\nsense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total\nspinoff.\n    Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of\nShearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for\nAmerican Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last\nyear.\n    \"I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is\ngoing to sell shearson,\" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.\nHe questioned what would be a better investment than \"a very\nprofitable securities firm.\"\n    Several analysts said American Express is not in need of\ncash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong\nasset.\n    But others believe the company could very well of\nconsidered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one\nrumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.\n    Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he\nbelieves American Express could have considered a partial\nspinoff in the past.\n    \"Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a\nbig premium in the market place. Shearson\'s book value is in\nthe 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would\nprobably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market\ncapitalization,\" said Eckenfelder.\n    Some analysts said American Express could use capital since\nit plans to expand globally.\n    \"They have enormous internal growth plans that takes\ncapital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to\nenhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the\nroad,\" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.\n    \"They\'ve outlined the fact that they\'re investing heavily\nin the future, which goes heavily into the international\narena,\" said Lewis. \"...That does not preclude acquisitions and\ndivestitures along the way,\" he said.\n    Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the\nbrokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might\nbetter reflect other assets, such as the travel related\nservices business.\n    \"It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure\nto brokerage. The value of the other components could command a\nhigher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of\nthe total operating earnings of the company,\" he said.\n     Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax\noperating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.\n   \n Reuter\n&#3;',0

Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the\nsenate agriculture committee.\n    The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates\ncompared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.\n    The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on\nthe program\'s impact on the USDA loan program.\n    If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan\nentries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of\nthe program would go up. However, if it is determined that\ncertificates have caused the government grain stockpile to\ndecrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.\n    GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates\nprogram should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.\n    But a negative report on certificates \"will fuel the fire\nagainst certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase\nin the certificate program,\" an agricultural consultant said.\n    The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program,\nwhile USDA remains firmly committed to it.\n Reuter\n&#3;',0
